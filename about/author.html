One Sunday night, the Holy Spirit simply said, “Go.” He then joined the New Life Center church and became part of the orchestra, even prophesying on the trumpet. It was at NLC that he picked up his missions interest, being involved in the Malaysian student group and then in the Chinese Church ministry. Peter was given a book on the Chinese language, and China became his adopted country.<br/><br/>After majoring in Chemistry at Canterbury University, he added Chinese to his Science degree and was then twice invited to go to China to teach English. While there, he travelled extensively around the country. Those years were foundational for later opportunities for ministry.<br/><br/>During the second tent-making experience, the missions pastor from Christchurch NLC told him he didn&#x27;t belong in their church. Unusual for a pastor to say that, but Peter knew God was speaking to him. Returning to New Zealand, Peter married Shienping, a Malaysian student whom God had clearly instructed was His choice for him to marry. Shienping was also told in a dream that Peter was to be her husband. After getting married in Wellington, they both moved to Hamilton in 1990 and joined the Elim church. Max Palmer had been accurate in his prophetic word, three years earlier.<br/><br/>Peter&#x27;s research into the Creation / Evolution issue began in 1988.
