One Sunday night, the Holy Spirit simply said, “Go.” He then joined the New Life Center church and became part of the orchestra, even prophesying on the trumpet. It was at NLC that he picked up his missions interest, being involved in the Malaysian student group and then in the Chinese Church ministry.
