        In a day and age when Truth is being suppressed and right becomes wrong and wrong is encouraged, we need to get back to God&apos;s Word, the <b>BIBLE</b>. The <b>BIBLE</b> alone has the standards of Truth and Righteousness. God calls us to return to Him.
        <br /><br />
        The <b>BIBLE</b> provides us with everything we need to know about ourselves, our origins, our present condition and our eternal destination. Our spiritual state is affecting the Earth, both the biological and physical world. It was our spiritual condition that is passionately sought after when Jesus came the first time as a lowly servant to redeem and save us from certain destruction.
        <br /><br />
        The purpose of this ministry is to provide resources for God&apos;s people, and to equip them in the Final Harvest of these last few years before the imminent return of Jesus the Messiah, as ruling King.
        <br /><br />
        May God Himself connect you to Himself in love and lead you in the Path of Life.
