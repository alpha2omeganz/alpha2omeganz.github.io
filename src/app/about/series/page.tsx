            <b>ALPHA series</b>
            <div className="flex">
              Twelve titles that were originally written for the Christian group at Hamilton Boys High School, in 2012. They were intended to be introductory to a range of Christian topics. They have since been used within the Home School programme around NZ.

            <b>BETA series</b>
            <div className="flex">
              A series of 10 comprehensive books. They are based on the NZ Science curriculum. They include all the topics that the author has taught during his 38 years in the classroom.

            <b>GAMMA series</b>
            <div className="flex">
              These are two independent books that are mostly critical investigations into: 1) Evolutionary assumptions, and 2) traditions within the Christian community, plus countering the critics that donâ€™t accept the historical reliability of Scripture.

            <b>DELTA series</b>
            <div className="flex">
            These biblically centred topics use sound exegesis (drawing from the text what the original author(s) meant to convey and in its proper context). As God the Holy Spirit is the ultimate author of all Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16), He still speaks to us today. So, some personal insights of a free-flowing disciple who has walked consistently with his Lord and Saviour for almost 50 years are included. Readers are encouraged to prayerfully consider what is presented - and like the Bereans (Acts 17:11), to test against Scripture for themselves.

              Twelve titles that take an in-depth look around regional New Zealand, examining evidences of a recent creation. Each field guide includes at least one special interest topic and a number of Christian scientists who worked in that general area of study.

            <b>OMEGA series</b>
            <div className="flex">
              This series of six titles examines the Church through the ages, beginning with Old Testament Church. It concludes with the signs and wonders happening around us, drawing attention to what we can expect in the closing days of this current Church Age. The views presented are NOT intended as dogmatic, but simply as one possible interpretation and viewpoint.
