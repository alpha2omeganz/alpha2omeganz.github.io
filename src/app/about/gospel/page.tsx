      <br/><br/>
      God loves us and He has given us the capacity to love Him. He designed and created us to have a two-way
      relationship with Him. However, we have sin, failure and shame in our lives which prevent us from realising that
      relationship. Sin in our lives is incredibly serious to a holy and righteous God, so much so that if we should die in our
      sins, we condemn ourselves to destruction. We cannot save ourselves. We cannot even come into God&apos;s presence
      because His holiness and purity would burn us up.
      <br/><br/>
      The <b>good news</b> is that Jesus has offered us an opportunity to come into right relationship with God. God has done
      this because Jesus came down (even though He is God) to Earth, and lived a life of service, compassion and
      reconciliation. He allowed Himself to take our place for our sins. He did this by being unjustly killed, although He was
      100% innocent. Then, as prophesied, Jesus rose from the dead with power over sin and death. By believing on His
      name and His forgiveness of our sins, He then takes our sin upon Himself and gives us salvation and a new start in
      life. There is no one else who can do this for us.

      <span className="text-lg font-bold">Why do we need the GOSPEL?</span>
      <br/><br/>
      The Gospel starts in Genesis 2. This was where Adam and Eve were created in God&apos;s likeness, as human
      representatives of God on Earth. They walked in relationship with Jesus (YHWH) in the Garden of Eden on a daily
      basis. YHWH gave them total freedom, but with one condition. That condition was not to eat of a particular fruit in
      the Garden. It was a test of love and trust.
      <br/><br/>
      At some time after being in the Garden, Eve and then Adam her husband, were tricked by Satan. They ate the fruit
      that God expressly said, “You shall not eat of it.” As a consequence of their disobedience, their relationship with God
      was broken, they died spiritually, and they became ensnared by Satan. They were then sentenced to exile outside
      the Garden.

      <span className="text-lg font-bold">The Importance of the Gospel</span>
      <br/><br/>
      God gives us a second chance, despite our weaknesses. He wants to put all the broken pieces in our life together and make something new, something of value, and something beautiful. He takes away our guilt, shame, depression, and our insecurities. He then gives us hope, joy and peace, to a depth that cannot be found in temporary pleasures. We can now have full assurance of going to Heaven when we&apos;ve finished this life, and being with God for eternity. We were made for Heaven, that is what we earnestly yearn for: love and acceptance and a place we can call home.

      <br/><br/>
      Once we have made that decision to ask Jesus to remove our sin and give us His Holy Spirit as a promise of our salvation, we need to make the decision to want to be like Jesus. We can&apos;t do this in our own strength – we need to ask Him to change us to make us more like Him. 
      <br/><br/>
      Four ways of doing this are by: regularly reading His word and doing what it says; praying and listening to Him; meeting with other followers of Jesus whose desire and passion is to follow Him. Finally, get baptised. This is a public confession that you are putting your old life behind you, and you want to follow Jesus wherever He would lead you. 
      <br/><br/>
      Doing God&apos;s will requires faith. Our faith in God is an experience that grows as we read and believe God&apos;s word and practice what the Bible says.
